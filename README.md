- Introduction:
    The purpose of this project it to implement a number of functions to create a a game of Mancala between 
    two players. This is a turn based game which consists of picking a cup and moving clockwise, around the 
    board and dropping one stone into each cup you pass. The player wins the game by having the most stones 
    in their own cup on the end of the board (indicated by their name). Key functionality is the board updating 
    values and the game recognizing which player won without being prompted by the user to evaluate.

3) Trouble Shooting
- Common issues
